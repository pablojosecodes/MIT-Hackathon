## Alone Together

This was a hackthon project I coded during the 2023 [MIT Reality Hack](https://www.mitrealityhack.com), with my fantastic teammates [Oren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oren-nelson?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACbQadUBR4WR9HX2t6vlxkouKvmP6z4o60k&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BdFR7aq%2B5Ro%2B%2BoUXFTz%2FCRw%3D%3D), [Andre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-benedito?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACzWX5kBwFUgHY7cdKIMK-eZBzW2XrlGxG4&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3Bc5jSRiOKReeA78%2BuLyB2Jw%3D%3D), and [Yangli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangli-l-0829a08b?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAABMwhmIBUdydImnNmwT_PNd5Pbxzd0aknLg&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BDhR%2FeSSSS8Wme%2FKieM%2B5xw%3D%3D).

Our main unity developer got into a car crash the first night of the event, so we all had to step up and learn some new tools and coding processes, but it was a
great time.
